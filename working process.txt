Our project is supported by two microcontrollers. One is a raspberry pi and the other is an Arduino. We have used the Android based operating system lineage for Raspberry Pi. And we have used the HC-05 Bluetooth module to connect with Arduino via Bluetooth. We have developed an app for image processing. When the camera detects a bottle or any trash, our application will send data to Arduino. Then Arduino will process the data and open the bottle entry chamber. There's an IR sensor inside the chamber. On the other hand, it will send signal to Arduino to make sure the bottle has entered properly. After this, it sends data to the candy station. The data will be sent to Raspberry Pi via Bluetooth. After this, it will play a short animation based on the impacts of plastic pollution on the display. Besides this, if it finds any trash falling in the ground by scanning autonomously using image processing, it will go near the trash by measuring distance. The whole system is based on Artificial Intelligence.
